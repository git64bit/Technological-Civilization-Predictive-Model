An approach to forecasting the minimum number of trained individuals required to maintain the functionality and advancement of our Technological Human Civilization.
Sustaining Technological Civilization: A Predictive Algebraic Model for Workforce Sustainability

## Summary
This project aims to forecast the minimum number of trained individuals required to maintain the functionality and advancement of our Technological Human Civilization. Leveraging algebraic principles and computational techniques, the project addresses the complex interplay between workforce demand, industry sectors, and occupational titles. By integrating key parameters such as skill acquisition time, work duration, and sector-specific workforce dynamics, the implemented models offer insights into workforce sustainability across diverse sectors.

## Description
The project endeavors to develop an algebraic system that quantifies the essential workforce requirements necessary to sustain our Technological Human Civilization. Drawing upon empirical data and theoretical frameworks, the model accounts for various factors influencing workforce dynamics, including skill acquisition duration, labor market demands, and occupational specialization. Utilizing Python programming and SQLite database management, the system will analyze the intricate relationships between industry sectors listed in the North American Industry Classification (NAIC) system and the corresponding occupational titles.

Central to the research is the recognition that different sectors exhibit distinct workforce compositions and operational dependencies. For instance, while a restaurant may require multiple waitstaff to accommodate customer needs, it may only necessitate a single chef to prepare meals. By integrating sector-specific workforce parameters and employment trends, the model aims to provide nuanced insights into optimal workforce allocation strategies.

The project's innovative approach seeks to address pressing questions surrounding workforce sustainability in the context of technological advancement and societal development. By leveraging computational tools and algebraic methodologies, the research endeavors to inform policy-making, workforce planning, and resource allocation efforts aimed at fostering a resilient and adaptive Technological Human Civilization.
