# Technological-Civilization-Predictive-Model
An approach to forecasting the minimum number of trained individuals required to maintain the functionality and advancement of our Technological Human Civilization.
Sustaining Technological Civilization: A Predictive Algebraic Model for Workforce Sustainability

## Summary
This project aims to forecast the minimum number of trained individuals required to maintain the functionality and advancement of our Technological Human Civilization. Leveraging algebraic principles and computational techniques, the project addresses the complex interplay between workforce demand, industry sectors, and occupational titles. By integrating key parameters such as skill acquisition time, work duration, and sector-specific workforce dynamics, the implemented models offer insights into workforce sustainability across diverse sectors.

## Description
The project endeavors to develop an algebraic system that quantifies the essential workforce requirements necessary to sustain our Technological Human Civilization. Drawing upon empirical data and theoretical frameworks, the model accounts for various factors influencing workforce dynamics, including skill acquisition duration, labor market demands, and occupational specialization. Utilizing Python programming and SQLite database management, the system will analyze the intricate relationships between industry sectors listed in the North American Industry Classification (NAIC) system and the corresponding occupational titles.

Central to the research is the recognition that different sectors exhibit distinct workforce compositions and operational dependencies. For instance, while a restaurant may require multiple waitstaff to accommodate customer needs, it may only necessitate a single chef to prepare meals. By integrating sector-specific workforce parameters and employment trends, the model aims to provide nuanced insights into optimal workforce allocation strategies.

The project's innovative approach seeks to address pressing questions surrounding workforce sustainability in the context of technological advancement and societal development. By leveraging computational tools and algebraic methodologies, the research endeavors to inform policy-making, workforce planning, and resource allocation efforts aimed at fostering a resilient and adaptive Technological Human Civilization.

## GitHub Repository Outline: Sustaining Technological Civilization
### 1. Project Structure
#### /src: Directory containing the source code for the Python project.
#### /data: Directory for storing input data files and SQLite database.
#### /docs: Directory for project documentation.
#### /tests: Directory for unit tests.

### 2. Design Decisions
#### Object-Oriented Approach:
Adopting an object-oriented design paradigm facilitates modularity, code reusability, and maintainability. Each component of the predictive algebraic model, such as sectors, occupations, and workforce dynamics, will be encapsulated within Python classes.

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:
Utilizing the MVC architectural pattern enables a clear separation of concerns and promotes scalability. The model layer handles data manipulation and calculations, the view layer manages user interface interactions, and the controller layer orchestrates communication between the model and view.

#### SQLite Database Integration:
Storing input data and intermediate results in an SQLite database provides a lightweight, efficient solution for data persistence. This allows for seamless integration with Python code and simplifies data retrieval and manipulation tasks.

#### Unit Testing:
Implementing comprehensive unit tests ensures the reliability and correctness of the predictive algebraic model. Test-driven development (TDD) practices will be employed to validate individual components and verify system functionality.
